# LangGraph Overview: State-Based Agent Orchestration

LangGraph is built on the concept of modeling agent execution as a directed graph.

Core Components:

* State: A shared data structure (often a TypedDict) that represents the current snapshot of your application and is updated by nodes.
* Node: A Python function that takes the current 'state', performs a task (e.g., calling an LLM), and returns an 'update' to the state.
* Edge: Defines the transition logic between nodes.
    * Normal Edge: Unconditional transition.
    * Conditional Edge: Calls a function to determine the next node based on the current 'state'.
* StateGraph: The main class used to build and compile the workflow.

Benefit: Enables durable execution (saving state), streaming, interrupts, and time-travel debugging.
